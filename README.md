# chandler
Chandler is a middleware API that sits between a client who does not have administrator privileges to OpenShift and the backend clusters themselves, performing operations on behalf of the client. The name comes from a term to describe merchants that sell ship provisions directly to vessels - tying in with Kubernetes and its nautical themes.
